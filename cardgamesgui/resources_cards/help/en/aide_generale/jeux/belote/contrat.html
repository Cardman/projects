Bids fix the deal.<br/>
<br/>
Each player speaks, in counter clock wise,<br/>
by beginning by the player at the right of the dealer.<br/>
<br/>
A player has to either pass or bid.<br/>
<br/>
At the classic belote, one processes by two rounds:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>At the first round:<br/>
&nbsp;If a player bids, then one''s takes the "top" card and bidding is stopped in order to go to play cards.</li>
<li>At the second round:<br/>
&nbsp;If a player bids, then one''s declares a suit which is going to lead the other one during this deal.<br/>
&nbsp;In this case, one''s cannot declare the suit of the "top" card.<br/>
&nbsp;One''s takes the "top" card and bidding is stopped in order to go to play cards.<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
If someone takes, then the dealer deals two cards to the taker and three cards to the other players by beginning by the starter (the player who begins).<br/>
<br/>
Meaning: the second round is played only if everybody has pass.<br/>
<br/>
At the coinche, one processes by the following way:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>A player can pass or declare a suit with a number of points to score.<br/>
&nbsp;The declared points vary by ten to ten from 80 to 160.<br/>
&nbsp;Declaring 162 points means the player must make all tricks and begins playing</li>
<li>For over bidding, il faut annoncer une couleur avec dix points de plus.</li>
<li>Even by passing while a round, bidding a suit with points is possible while a latter round.</li>
<li>If three consecutive players pass, then bidding is stopped in order to go to play cards.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
Meaning: if a player declares 162 points for a suit, then bidding is stopped, as other players must pass.<br/>
<br/>
The taker plays with the player on the opposite side against the two other players.<br/>
