The player who deals cards is called dealer.<br/>
From a deal to an other, the dealer changes,<br/>
that is say the next dealer is the player at the right of the previous dealer,<br/>
and the cards are mixed at each time.<br/>
The cards are dealt one by one.<br/>
It is never if some players have one more card than other players.<br/>
