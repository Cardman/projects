As for all card games, there are variants.<br/>
<br/>
Here is some variants:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>Equaling is forbidden: all player cannot play group of cards of same strength as the last group.</li>
<br/>
<li>Equaling skips always the next player: if two groups of same strength are played, the next player is skipped, (this player cannot play at this moment, but can after).</li>
<br/>
<li>Equaling urge the next player to equal again: if two groups of same strength are played, the next player has to equal or pass, (this player can play only group of same strength at this moment, but can play any group after). If all cards of same strength are consecutively played in the trick, the trick ends like playing group of 2.</li>
<br/>
<li>All player have to play if possible. (cannot pass)</li>
<br/>
<li>If a player ends with a group of 2, the player can loose the deal. (If two players end with a group of 2, the last player looses.)</li>
<br/>
<li>If 4 cards are played at once, the order is reversed (The 2 become weak and the 3 become strong.). If 4 other cards are played at once, reversing is cancelled.</li>
<br/>
<li>For next deals, the player at the last rank switches 2 cards with the player at the first rank and the player at the before last rank switches 1 card with the player at the second rank.<br/>
The losers give their best cards. The winners give cards of their choice.</li>
<br/>
<li>For next deals, the player at the last rank starts the first trick.</li>
<br/>
<li>Other card games can be added.</li>
<br/>
<li>Cards can be dealt in the clock wise.</li>
</ol>
