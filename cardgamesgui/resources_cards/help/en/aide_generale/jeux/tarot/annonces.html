The base declaring are handful and slam.<br/>
<br/>
For slam, if the taker owns besides the Excuse, the taker must play it at the last trick,<br/>
because the taker has no partner and the Excuse, played before the last trick, does not allow to lead.<br/>
<br/>
A handful is a hand containing only trump cards (The Excuse can be a trump card).<br/>
Adjectives simple, double et triple qualify the number of present trump cards in the handful.<br/>
<br/>
The minimal numbers of trump cards (Excuse included) for declaring a simple handful,<br/>
a double handful and a triple handful are respectively 10, 13 and 15.<br/>
<br/>
The Excuse can belong to a handful only if the full number of trump cards (Excuse included) is the matching minimal number.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>If a player owns 9 trump cards and the Excuse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then for declaring the simple handful, the declarer must add the Excuse in the handful.<br/>
</li>
<li>If a player owns 10 trump cards and the Excuse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then for declaring the simple handful, the declarer must not add the Excuse in the handful.<br/>
</li>
<li>If a player owns 13 trump cards and the Excuse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the player has not to declare a double handful.<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
Declaring handfuls or miseres is done at the beginning of deal by playing the first card.<br/>
Handfuls must be shown, while declaring handfuls or else, there may be false declaring.<br/>
