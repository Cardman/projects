A slam is a declaring when, the declarer (the player who has declared it) must win all tricks, that is says win the cards of the opponents of the player.<br/>
For declaring it, the player must declare a bid other than "Pass".<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>If the taker has declared "Take" or "Guard":<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog is shown to all players.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The taker takes the "dog" cards.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For having the same number of cards than the other players, the taker discards from the hand the same number of cards as the dog contained.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The taker cannot discard trump cards(The Excuse is, here, a trump card.) or kings.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For trump cards, if the taker has a sum of number of trump cards (The Excuse is, here, a trump card.) and number of kings(trump cards + kings)greater than the number of cards per player,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the taker shows the discarded trump cards to the defense,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in this case, the taker can now discard them from the hand.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The discarded cards from the hand are hidden for the defense.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After discarding cards to the dog, the taker can declare a slam.<br/>
</li>
<li>If the taker has declared "Guard without" or "Guard against":<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog stays hidden.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the taker has declared "Guard without", then the dog belongs to the taker.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the taker has declared "Guard against", then the dog belongs to the defense.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The taker can declare a slam.<br/>
</li>
</ol>
