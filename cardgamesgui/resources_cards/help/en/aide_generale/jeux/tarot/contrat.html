Bids determine the deal.<br/>
<br/>
Each player declares a bid, in the counter clock wise,<br/>
by beginning by the player at the right of the dealer.<br/>
<br/>
A player must either declare "pass", or declare a bid greater than the previous bids.<br/>
Each player has to declare once.<br/>
<br/>
At tarot, there are 5 bids, in the order from the lowest to the greatest:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>Pass</li>
<li>Take</li>
<li>Guard</li>
<li>Guard without</li>
<li>Guard against</li>
</ol>
<br/>
After that all players have bid, the player having declared the strongest bid becomes the taker.<br/>
In function of the declared bid by the taker, about the dog, one processes by the following way:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Take: the taker takes the dog and shows it to the other players.</li>
<li>Guard: the taker takes the dog and shows it to the other players.</li>
<li>Guard without: the taker takes the dog but the dog stays hidden.</li>
<li>Guard against: the taker leaves the dog to the opponents of the player and the dog stays hidden.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<br/>
Meanings:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>The opponents of the taker are the defense.</li>
<li>There is only one round of bidding.(Each player declares only once.)</li>
</ol>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>If the 1st player, who must speak, declares "pass",<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the 2nd declares "Take",<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the 3rd cannot declare "Take", but the 3rd can declare "Guard" or greater.<br/>
</li>
<li>If the 1st player, who must speak, declares "pass",<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the 2nd declares "Take",<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the 3rd declares "pass",<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the last one declares "Guard without",<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the taker is the last player.<br/>
</li>
<li>If the 1st player, who must speak, declares "pass",<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the 2nd declares "Guard against",<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then, the two other players must declares "pass".<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
The taker plays against the three other players.<br/>
