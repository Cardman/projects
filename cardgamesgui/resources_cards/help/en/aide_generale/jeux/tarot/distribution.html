The player who deals cards is the dealer.<br/>
From a deal to an other, the dealer changes,<br/>
that is say the next dealer is the player at the right of the previous dealer,<br/>
and the game is mixed and cut at each time.<br/>
<br/>
Each player owns 18 cards and 6 cards make up a deck (called dog),<br/>
the cards are dealt 3 by 3.<br/>
<br/>
The cards, hidden side, which make up the dog,<br/>
are dealt card by card at any time,<br/>
except for the first round and for the last round.<br/>
The dealer deals in the counter clock wise.<br/>
<br/>
After all cards are dealt,<br/>
if a player owns only the Small as trump card<br/>
(It is said the Small is dried. The Excuse is, here, a trump card.) in the hand of the player,<br/>
then the deal is cancelled. The cards are redealt, in this case.<br/>
