<br/>
&nbsp;Nb means "Number".<br/>
&nbsp;+- means "Plus or minus".<br/>
&nbsp;pts means "points".<br/>
&nbsp;"Plus or minus 25" (+-25) means:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker succeeds the taker''s bid, it is worth "plus 25",<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker looses, it is worth "minus 25".<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>Ace to end:<br/>
<ul>
<li>10 pts, if the team of the taker wins the Small in the last trick.</li>
<li>-10 pts, if the defense wins the Small in the last trick.</li>
<li>0 pts, else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Handfuls:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Simple: 20 pts, if the declarer wins the deal; -20 pts, else.</li>
<li>Double: 30 pts, if the declarer wins the deal; -30 pts, else.</li>
<li>Triple: 40 pts, if the declarer wins the deal; -40 pts, else.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>chelem:<br/>
<ol>
<li>successful declared: 400 pts.</li>
<li>successful not declared: 200 pts.</li>
<li>failed declared: -200 pts.</li>
<li>failed not declared: 0 pts.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Rate of bid:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Take: 1.</li>
<li>Guard: 2.</li>
<li>Guard without: 4.</li>
<li>Guard against: 6.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Success of a bid:<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>56 points needed without oudler.</li>
<li>51 points needed with 1 oudler won in the tricks of the taker.</li>
<li>41 points needed with 2 oudlers won in the tricks of the taker.</li>
<li>36 points needed with 3 oudlers won in the tricks of the taker.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of points for a deal: 91 points.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Difference = Nb pts scored by the taker - Nb pts needed for winning the deal, for the taker<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Score of the taker without declaring points = +-25pts + Difference + Ace to end<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Declaring = Handfuls + Slam<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of a defender = - (Score of the taker without declaring points x Rate of bid + Declaring taker - Declaring defense)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of the taker = -3 x Full score total of a defender<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>If the taker scores 43 points with 2 Oudlers in the tricks of the taker, by declaring "Take", neither declaring handful for all players, nor slam,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if no player has played the Small at the last trick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the taker wins the deal with 2 points and scores ((25+(43-41)+0)x1+0+0)x3=81 points, and each defender scores ((-25-(43-41)+0)x1+0+0)X1=-27 points.<br/>
</li>
<li>If the taker scores 43 points with 1 Oudler in the tricks of the taker, by declaring "Take", neither declaring handful for all players, nor slam,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if no player has played the Small at the last trick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the taker looses the deal with 8 points and scores ((-25+(43-51)+0)x1+0+0)x3=-99 points, and each defender scores ((25-(43-51)+0)x1+0+0)X1=33 points.<br/>
</li>
<li>If the taker scores 60 points avec 2 Oudlers in the tricks of the taker, by declaring "Guard", with a double handful, without handfuls for the defense, without slam,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker has played the Small at the last round without loosing it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the taker wins the deal with 19 points and scores ((25+(60-41)+10)x2+30+0)x3=414 points, and each defender scores ((-25-(60-41)-10)x2-30+0)X1=-138 points.<br/>
