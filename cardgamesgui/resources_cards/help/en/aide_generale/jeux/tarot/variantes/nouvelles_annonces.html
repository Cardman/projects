The declaring miseres are:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Misere of trump: no trump card(The Excuse is a trump card here).</li>
<li>Misere of points: neither Oudler nor characters.</li>
<li>Misere of low cards: no low card from ace to ten.</li>
<li>Misere of suit: only trump cards and possibly the Excuse.</li>
<li>Misere of characters: no characters card.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Declaring misere is done as the same time than declaring handfuls, before playing the first card.<br/>
<br/>
Their respective values are: 10, 10, 20, 30, 5.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of deal,<br/>
<ul>
<li>If the taker declares miseres, then the declaring miseres points are added to declaring points of the taker.</li>
<li>If the possible partner of the taker declares miseres, then the declaring miseres points are added to declaring points of the taker.</li>
<li>If a defender declares miseres, then the declaring miseres points are remove from declaring points of the taker.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Example: (at 4 players classic)<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;If the taker scores 43 points with 2 Oudlers in the tricks, by declaring "Take", without declaring handfuls for the 4 players, without slam,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by with a misere of trump declared by a defender,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if none of 4 players has played the Small at the last trick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the taker wins the deal by 2 points and scores ((25+(43-41)+0)x1+0+0-10)x3=51 points, and each defender scores ((-25-(43-41)+0)x1+0+0+10)X1=-17 points.<br/>
