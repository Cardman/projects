Here is changes with tarot played by 4 players from the classic way:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>Repartition of teams<br/>
<ol>
<li>First variant, the most played one:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all players having declared,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the taker calls the king of a suit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker has the 4 kings, the taker calls the queen of a suit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker has the 4 queens and the 4 kings, the taker calls the knight of a suit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker has the 4 knights, the 4 queens and the 4 kings, the taker calls the jack of a suit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker has the 16 characters, the taker calls an Oudler.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In function by rules, the call can be done before or after the dog.<br/>
</li>
<li>Second variant:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all players having declared,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the taker calls a character of a suit or an Oudler.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In function by rules, the call can be done before or after the dog.<br/>
</li>
<li>Third variant:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all players having declared,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the taker is the partner of the player in the opposite side.<br/>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Calculation of scores at the end of deal:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of points for a deal: 91 points<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Difference = Nb pts scored by the taker - Nb pts needed for winning the deal, for the taker<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Score of the taker without declaring points = +-25pts + Difference + Ace to end<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Declaring = Handfuls + Slam + Possible Miseres<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of a defender = - (Score of the taker without declaring points x Rate of bid + Declaring taker - Declaring defense)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the taker has a partner<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of the taker = -1,5 x Full score total of a defender<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Else<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of the taker = -3 x Full score total of a defender<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of the possible called player = -0,5 Full score total of a defender<br/>
</li>
</ol>
