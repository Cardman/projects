Here is changes with tarot played by 4 players:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>dealing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each player owns 12 cards and 6 make up the dog,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cards are dealt 2 by 2.<br/>
</li>
<li>Repartition of teams<br/>
<ol>
<li>First variant:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taker is a partner of the player of the opposite side.<br/>
</li>
<li>Second variant:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all players having declared,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the taker calls the king of a suit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker has the 4 kings, the taker calls the queen of a suit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker has the 4 queens and the 4 kings, the taker calls the knight of a suit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker has the 4 knights, the 4 queens and the 4 kings, the taker calls the jack of a suit.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In function by rules, the call can be done before or after the dog.<br/>
</li>
<li>Third variant:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all players having declared,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the taker calls a character of a suit.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In function by rules, the call can be done before or after the dog.<br/>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Declaring handfuls:<br/>
<li>simple handful: 6 trump cards (The Excuse is a trump card).</li>
<li>double handful: 8 trump cards (The Excuse is a trump card).</li>
<li>triple handful: 10 trump cards (The Excuse is a trump card).</li>
</li>
<li>Calculation of scores at the end of deal:<br/>
<ol>
<li>If no call is necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of points for a deal: 91 points<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difference = Nb pts scored by the taker - Nb pts needed for winning the deal, for the taker<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Score of the taker without declaring points = +-25pts + Difference + Ace to end<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declaring = Handfuls + Slam + Possible Miseres<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of a defender = - (Score of the taker without declaring points x Rate of bid + Declaring taker - Declaring defense)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of the taker = -2 x Full score total of a defender<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of the possible called player = -2 x Full score total of a defender<br/>
</li>
<li>Else&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of points for a deal: 91 points<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difference = Nb pts scored by the taker - Nb pts needed for winning the deal, for the taker<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Score of the taker without declaring points = +-25pts + Difference + Ace to end<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declaring = Handfuls + Slam + Possible Miseres<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of a defender = - (Score of the taker without declaring points x Rate of bid + Declaring taker - Declaring defense)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the taker has a partner<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of the taker = -3 x Full score total of a defender<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Else<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of the taker = -5 x Full score total of a defender<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of the possible called player = - Full score total of a defender<br/>
