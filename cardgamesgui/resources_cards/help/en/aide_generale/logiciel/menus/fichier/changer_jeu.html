Change game (shortcut: CTRL + J)<br/>
The action of the sub menu "Change game" lets change the "state of the software",<br/>
by returning to the menu with names of games.<br/>
<br/>
If a deal is being played, and if the deal has not been just saved, then<br/>
a warning message for the deal in progress appears.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, the user has the choice between three options:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>No</li>
<li>Cancel</li>
</ol>
If the user has chosen "yes", then a dialog box for saving appears and<br/>
the user must give a name to the deal in progress.<br/>
<br/>
If the user has chosen "No", then there is change of "state of the software".<br/>
<br/>
If the user has chosen "Cancel", then nothing happens.<br/>
