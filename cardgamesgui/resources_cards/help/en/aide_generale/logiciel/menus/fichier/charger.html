Load a deal (shortcut: CTRL + O)<br/>
The sub menu "Load a deal" opens a dialog box which lets load<br/>
any deal from this dialog box.<br/>
<br/>
If a deal is being played, and if the deal has not been just saved, then<br/>
a warning message for the deal in progress appears.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, the user has the choice between three options:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>No</li>
<li>Cancel</li>
</ol>
If the user has chosen "yes", then a dialog box for saving appears and<br/>
the user must give a name to the deal in progress.<br/>
<br/>
If the user has chosen "no", then a dialog box of loading is opened.<br/>
<br/>
If the user has chosen "cancel", then nothing happens.<br/>
<br/>
The user can play or replay<br/>
a saved deal from a file. Besides, if the deal is edited, the user can play<br/>
the next deals if the user has chosen to play several consecutive deals.<br/>
<br/>
Folders are grouped on a tree at the left of the dialog box.<br/>
Their content will be placed at the right of the dialog box, like Windows Explorer.<br/>
<br/>
The button "Cancel" lets close the dialog box.<br/>
<br/>
The user can search a file in the current folder with a text field above the content of folder.<br/>
<br/>
If the user clicks a file of the enumerated list of files, then the dialog box is disposed.<br/>
Then:<br/>
<ol>
<li>If the file is readable, then the deal (Either a simple deal or a set of deals,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the case when it is a set of deals, the loaded deal is the last played deal.), contained in this file, will be loaded.</li>
<li>Else an error message appears displaying the loading fail.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
Deals are checked about rules for avoiding bugs.<br/>
