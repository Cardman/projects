The player who deals cards is called dealer.<br/>
From a deal to an other, the dealer changes,<br/>
that is say the next dealer is the player at the right of the previous dealer,<br/>
and the cards are mixed and cut at each time.<br/>
<br/>
At the classic belote,<br/>
each player owns, at the beginning, 5 cards. The remaining cards (equals to 12) make up a deck,<br/>
the cards are dealt 3 by 3, then 2 by 2.<br/>
<br/>
Once all players have five cards, the "top" card of the deck must be shown.<br/>
<br/>
At the coinche,<br/>
each player owns 8 cards,<br/>
the cards are dealt 3 by 3, then 2 by 2 for the last one.<br/>
<br/>
The dealer deals in the counter clock wise.<br/>
