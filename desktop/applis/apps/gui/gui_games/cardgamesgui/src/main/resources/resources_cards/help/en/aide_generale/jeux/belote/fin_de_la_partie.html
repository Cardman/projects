&nbsp;pts means "points".<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>Ten of last trick, (Win the last trick): 10 points.</li>
<li>Belote rebelote: 20 points.</li>

</ol>

<li>Success of bid:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full points for a deal: 162 points.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Score of the taker without declaring points = Nb pts scored by the taker and the taker''s partner + Ten of last trick if the taker''s team wins the last trick.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Declaring = Belote rebelote<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary full score of the taker = Declaring of the taker''s team + Score of the taker without declaring point<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the belote rebelote has been declared during the deal:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the full score of the taker is lower than 91 points,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the full score is set to zero (The taker looses.).<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Else the temporary full score of the taker becomes definitive.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Else<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the full score of the taker is lower than 81 points,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the full score is set to zero (The taker looses.).<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Else the temporary full score of the taker becomes definitive.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of defender = 162 - definitive full score of the taker<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the taker looses and if the belote rebelote has been declared during the deal:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the full score of a defender is 182.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The taker''s partner and the taker win the same points.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If all tricks are won by the taker''s team,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the chelem points are added to full score of each player of the taker''s team.<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<ol>
<li>If the taker''s team scores 75 points in one''s tricks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker''s team win the last trick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the defense owns the declaring belote rebelote,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the taker has a temporary score of 85 points, that is under 91 points.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So the taker looses the deal and score zero points and one''s partner also, and each defender scores 182 points.</li>
<li>If the taker''s team scores 75 points in one''s tricks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker''s team win the last trick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the taker has a temporary score of 85 points, that is over 81 points.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So the taker wins the deal and scores 85 points and one''s partner also, and each defender scores 77 points.</li>
<li>If the taker''s team wins all tricks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker''s team owns the declaring belote rebelote,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the taker has a temporary score of 182 points, that is over 81 points.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So the taker wins the deal and scores 282 points and one''s partner also, and each defender scores zero points.</li>
