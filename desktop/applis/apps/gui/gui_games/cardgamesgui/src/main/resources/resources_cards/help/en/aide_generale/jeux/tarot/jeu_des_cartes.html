The tarot is played card by card.<br/>
A trick is a set of cards won by a player having played the strongest card. The player having won a trick can start the next trick.(Example: the player having played the trump 21 can start the next trick.).<br/>
<br/>
The player who starts the trick is called as starter.<br/>
The player who has played the strongest card of a trick is called as the winner of trick, the player wins the trick.<br/>
<br/>
The dominant suit is the suit of the first played card in the trick if the card is not the Excuse; the suit of the second card else.<br/>
A trick is cut if there is at least one trump card (Excuse excluded).<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>Playing the first card<br/>
<br/>
The player at the right of dealer begins playing a card of the choice of the player, once the taker has made up the dog.<br/>
In case of slam, this is the taker who begins playing.<br/>
</li>
<li>Rules<br/>
<br/>
The Excuse can be played at any trick.<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>If the first card is the Excuse,<br/>
then the next player can play any card.<br/>
</li>
<li>If the dominant suit is the trump suit (The Excuse, here, is not a trump card.),<br/>
<ol>
<li>If the player does not own any trump card<br/>
the player can play any card.
</li>
<li>If the player can play a greater trump card,<br/>
then the player must play a greater trump card.<br/>
</li>
<li>else, the player must play any trump card,<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
</li>
<li>If the dominant suit is not the trump suit,<br/>
<ol>
<li>If the player owns cards of the suit of the first card,<br/>
then the player must follow any card of the dominant suit.<br/>
</li>
<li>Else if the player does not own any trump card,<br/>
the player can play any card.</li>
<li>Else if no trump card is played,<br/>
the player must play any trump card, the player trumps.</li>
<li>Else if the player can play a greater card than the current strongest played trump card,<br/>
then the player must play a greater trump card than the previous trump cards, the player owertrumps.<br/>
</li>
<li>else the player must play any trump card, the player undertrumps.<br/>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<br/>
Before the last trick, the Excuse does not let win a trick. The Excuse is untakable.<br/>
The Excuse is substituted by a low card or a trump card numbered from 2 to 20.<br/>
<br/>
At the last trick, if all previous tricks are not won by the team of the player owing the Excuse (or by the taker),<br/>
then the Excuse is takable and belongs to the team of the player who wins the last trick.<br/>
<br/>
If a player with possibly partners wins tricks from the 1st to the before last trick and played the Excuse at the last trick,<br/>
then the player achieves a slam even not declared.<br/>
The possible partner(s) of a player, declaring a slam, have/has not to play the Excuse at the last trick.<br/>
