Here is the difference with playing by teams (Taker + possible called player versus Defense):<br/>
<br/>
Possible dealing are the following one:<br/>
<ul>
<li>18 cards per player and 6 at the dog; cards are dealt 3 by 3; for 4 players.</li>
<li>24 cards per player and 6 at the dog; cards are dealt 3 by 3; for 3 players.</li>
<li>15 cards per player and 3 at the dog; cards are dealt 3 by 3; for 5 players.</li>
<li>14 cards per player and 8 at the dog; cards are dealt 2 by 2; for 5 players.</li>
<li>12 cards per player and 6 at the dog; cards are dealt 2 by 2; for 6 players.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Playing discard can be done after all players have declared "pass".<br/>
<br/>
In this case, the dog is hidden.<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to loose the most cards as possible, so loose the Excuse at the last trick is great in this case.<br/>
<br/>
There is neither declaring nor bonuses.<br/>
<br/>
Else the deal progresses like game by teams (Same rules for playing cards.).<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Limits values not to be achieved for a player are the following one:<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>56 points without Oulder.</li>
<li>51 points with 1 Oulder in the tricks of the player.</li>
<li>41 points with 2 Oulders in the tricks of the player.</li>
<li>36 points with 3 Oulders in the tricks of the player.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
&nbsp;At the end of deal, for sorting players, one processes in the following way:<br/>
<br/>
Difference points of a player = limit value for the player - number of scored points in the tricks.<br/>
<br/>
Players are sorted by their difference points, the player having the greatest difference is the best player.<br/>
<br/>
If two players have same difference points and have won tricks:<br/>
&nbsp;Then the players are sorted by number of Oudlers in the tricks, the number of Oudlers must be the lowest as possible for winning.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;If besides, the number of Oudlers in the tricks of the two players is the same, then:<br/>
<ol>
<li>If this number is 0:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numbers of characters in the tricks of the two players is compared, the number of characters in the tricks of a player must be the lowest as possible for winning.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If besides, the number of characters in the tricks of the two players is the same, then:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Won characters by the two players are compared, by firstly comparing the greatest characters.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparison is stopped, if there is a difference of strength of card.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the characters have the same strength two by two for the two players,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the last player who has won a trick is before the other player.<br/>
</li>
<li>If this number is 1:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorting on Oudlers is based in the following way from the most winning to the most loosing: Small - Excuse - Trump 21.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Winning the Small is better than winning the Excuse,...)<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
If two players have same difference points but have not won any trick, there is dispute.<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>3 players<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate is worth from the winner to the looser:<br/>
<ul>
<li>1, 0, -1; if there is no dispute.</li>
<li>1, 1, -2; s''il y a litige.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>4 players<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate is worth from the winner to the looser:<br/>
<ul>
<li>2, 1, -1, -2; if there is no dispute.</li>
<li>2, 2, -1, -3; if there is dispute between two players exactly.</li>
<li>2, 2, 2, -6; if there is dispute between three players exactly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5 players<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate is worth from the winner to the looser:<br/>
<ul>
<li>2, 1, 0, -1, -2; if there is no dispute.</li>
<li>2, 2, 0, -1, -3; if there is dispute between two players exactly.</li>
<li>2, 2, 2, 0, -6; if there is dispute between three players exactly.</li>
<li>2, 2, 2, 2, -8; if there is dispute between four players exactly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>6 players<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate is worth from the winner to the looser:<br/>
<ul>
<li>3, 2, 1, -1, -2, -3; if there is no dispute.</li>
<li>3, 3, 0, -1, -2, -3; if there is dispute between two players exactly.</li>
<li>2, 2, 2, 0, -2, -4; if there is dispute between three players exactly.</li>
<li>2, 2, 2, 2, 0, -8; if there is dispute between four players exactly.</li>
<li>2, 2, 2, 2, 2, -10; if there is dispute between five players exactly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Score of a player = 4 x Rate x (25 + Maximal difference points for players rounded to the greater integer + number of points in the dog rounded to the greater integer).<br/>
<br/>
By teams of two players, rates are the following one:<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>4 players<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate is worth from the winner team to the looser team:<br/>
<ul>
<li>1, -1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>6 players<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate is worth from the winner team to the looser team:<br/>
<ul>
<li>1, 0, -1; if there is no dispute.</li>
<li>1, 1, -2; if there is dispute between two teams exactly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
