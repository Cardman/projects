Here is changes with tarot played by 4 players:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>dealing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;each player owns 24 cards and 6 cards make up the dog,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cards are dealt 3 by 3.<br/>
</li>
<li>Repartition of teams<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The taker plays against the other players.<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>Declaring handfuls:<br/>
<ol>
<li>simple handful: 12 trump cards (The Excuse is a trump card).</li>
<li>double handful: 15 trump cards (The Excuse is a trump card).</li>
<li>triple handful: 18 trump cards (The Excuse is a trump card).</li>
</ol>
<br/>
</li>
<li>Calculation of scores at the end of deal:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of points for a deal: 91 points<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Difference = Nb pts scored by the taker - Nb pts needed for winning the deal, for the taker<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Score of the taker without declaring points = +-25pts + Difference + Ace to end<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Declaring = Handfuls + Slam + Possible Miseres<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of a defender = - (Score of the taker without declaring points x Rate of bid + Declaring taker - Declaring defense)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full score of the taker = -2 x Full score total of a defender<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
&nbsp;If the taker score a not integer points,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the difference is rounded to the greater integer.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Examples:<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>If the taker scores 43,5 points with 2 Oudlers in the tricks, by declaring "Take", without declaring handfuls for all players, without slam,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if none of 3 players has played the Small at the last trick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the taker wins the deal by 3 points and scores ((25+(44-41)+0)x1+0+0+0)x2=56 points,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;each defender scores ((-25-(44-41)+0)x1+0+0+0)X1=-28 points.<br/>
</li>
<li>If the taker scores 43,5 points with 1 Oudler in the tricks, by declaring "Take", without declaring handfuls for all players, without slam,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if none of 3 players has played the Small at the last trick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taker has no partner,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then the taker looses the deal by 8 points and scores ((-25+(43-51)+0)x1+0+0+0)x2=-66 points, and each defender scores ((25-(43-51)+0)x1+0+0+0)X1=33 points.<br/>
</li>
</ol>
